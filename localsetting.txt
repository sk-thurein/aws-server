//AWS APP RUNNDER USER KEY
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users/details/trt-aws-developer?section=security_credentials

Access key is AKIAT34ZAMO7HOWMWECF
Secret access key is WMDfIev7yJp3/ycrMHUMaBSinV9spBUv/bFBXEbU

Step 1: Install Dependencies (On Second PC)
The second PC needs the same tools you installed on your MSI machine.

Bash
# 1. Update package list
sudo apt update

# 2. Install unzip (needed for AWS CLI installer)
sudo apt install unzip -y

# 3. Download and install AWS CLI v2
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# 4. Verify installation
aws --version
Note: Ensure Docker Desktop is installed on the Windows side and WSL Integration is toggled ON for this distro.

Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials
Use the same credentials you generated for the shinko-deployer user earlier.

Bash
aws configure
Enter the following when prompted:

AWS Access Key ID: [Your Access Key]

AWS Secret Access Key: [Your Secret Key]

Default region name: us-east-1

Default output format: json

Step 3: Clone the Code
Since the second PC needs the actual main.py and Dockerfile, you should move the files over (via USB, GitHub, or SSH). Once the files are in a folder (e.g., ~/shinko-health/aws-server), navigate there:

Bash
cd ~/shinko-health/aws-server
Step 4: The Deployment Sequence
Run these commands in order to push updates from the second PC.

1. Authenticate Docker with AWS
This "logs in" the second PC to your specific registry.

Bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 266071991230.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
2. Build the Docker Image
Bash
docker build -t shinko-health-app .
3. Tag the Image for the Shared Repository
Bash
docker tag shinko-health-app:latest 266071991230.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shinko-health-app:latest
4. Push to ECR
Bash
docker push 266071991230.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shinko-health-app:latest
Step 5: Verify the Automatic Update
Because you enabled Automatic Deployment in the App Runner console:

Open the App Runner Console.

Click on your service (shinko-health-api-east).

You will see the status change to "Operation in progress" automatically after the push finishes.

# Make the script executable (you only need to do this once)
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the script to deploy your code
./deploy.sh
